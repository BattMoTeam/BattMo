* IPOPT installation
  - [[https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt][Ipopt]] (Interior Point OPTimizer, pronounced eye-pea-Opt)) is a tool for nonlinear optimization
  - We use matlab interface provided by [[https://github.com/ebertolazzi/mexIPOPT][mexIPOPT]]
  - Installation described [[https://github.com/ebertolazzi/mexIPOPT/releases][here]]
    - open file IPOPT-toolbox.mltbx in Matlab
    - After installation, run the ~setup~ script inside the ipopt package. The location of this script may depend from
      your matlab installation. Check where the /MATLAB Add-Ons/ are installed. Running ~setup~ will add all the ipopt
      functionalities to the Matlab path, so they can be run.
