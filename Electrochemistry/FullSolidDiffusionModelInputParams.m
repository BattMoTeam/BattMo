    properties


        %% Standard Parameters


        % Function to update diffusion coefficient value, given as a struct with fields
        % - type         : element in {'function', 'constant'}. If 'constant' is chosen the value of referenceDiffusionCoefficient defined in parent class is used
        % - functionname : matlab function name (should be available in path)
        % - argumentlist : should be  ["c", "cmin", "cmax"]
        diffusionCoefficient    

        % The following parameters are only need in the case the diffusionCoefficient is given as a function (see argument list)
        saturationConcentration % the saturation concentration of the guest molecule in the host material (symbol: cmax)
        guestStoichiometry100   % the ratio of the concentration of the guest molecule to the saturation concentration
                                % of the guest molecule in a phase at a cell voltage that is defined as 100% SOC(symbol: theta100)
        guestStoichiometry0     % the ratio of the concentration of the guest molecule to the saturation concentration
                                % of the guest molecule in a phase at a cell voltage that is defined as 0% SOC (symbol: theta0)


        %% Discretization parameters
        
        % Number of discretization intervals in the diffusion model [-]
        N
        % Number of computational grid cells (typically set by parent model :class:`ActiveMaterial <Electrochemistry.ActiveMaterialInputParams>`)
