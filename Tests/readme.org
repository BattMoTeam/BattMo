* Information about the BattMo tests

** Octave vs MATLAB
The tests only run in MATLAB.


** Running the tests
The tests are run using the command `runtests`. To run all the
tests in path, run `runtests`.

To only run the test `TestBattery1D`, run `runtests('TestBattery1D')`.

To stop on first failure, run

```
import matlab.unittest.plugins.StopOnFailuresPlugin
suite = testsuite('TestBattery1D');
runner = testrunner('textoutput');
runner.addPlugin(StopOnFailuresPlugin)
results = runner.run(suite);
```

See `help runtests` for information.


** Reference data
Reference data are saved in json files found in
`TestExamples/ReferenceData`. For the naming convention, see how the
reference file is loaded in `Utilities/verifyStruct.m`.

See also `Utilities/verifyStruct.m` for how the comparison is made.

For example, the test `TestBattery1D` is essentially the example
`runBattery1D` without the plotting. This test runs the code twice,
testing both the CCCV and IEswitch controls. The reference data is
obtained from `states{end}`. The data in `states{end}` is saved to a
json file which the `runtests` code uses for comparison and
verification. The data can be saved to a json file using the following
code:
```
testname = 'TestBattery1DIEswitch.json';
s = jsonencode(states{end});
fid = fopen(testname, 'w');
fprintf(fid, s);
fclose(fid);
```
