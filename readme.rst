The Battery Modelling Toolbox (**BattMo**) is a resource for continuum modelling of electrochemical devices in MATLAB. The initial development features a pseudo X-dimensional (PXD) framework for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion battery cells. However, the development plan for BattMo includes extensions to other battery chemistries (e.g. metal-air) and eventually hydrogen systems (i.e. electrolyzers and fuel cells).

**BattMo** offers users a flexible framework for building fully coupled electrochemical-thermal simulations of electrochemical devices using 1D, 2D, or 3D geometries. **BattMo** is implemented in MATLAB and builds on the open-source MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (`MRST <https://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/MRST/>`_) developed at SINTEF. MRST provides a solid basis for finite volume grid generation of complex geometries and advanced numerical solvers that enable fast simulations for large systems.

Installation
------------

Before cloning this reposity you must make sure you have **Git LFS** installed. See `https://git-lfs.com` for instructions on downloading and installation.

BattMo is based on `MRST <https://www.sintef.no/Projectweb/MRST/>`_, which provides a general unstructured grid format,
generic MATLAB automatic differentiation tools and Newton solvers. The MRST source code wil be installed directly via
**git submodules**. To install BattMo, you have therefore to clone this repository with the submodule option
``--recurse-submodules``, as follows:

``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo.git``

Then start MATLAB and in the directory where you cloned the repository, run:

``startupBattMo``

You can check that that your installation is setup correctly by running one of the example scripts:

``runBatteryP2D``

Iterative solvers
-----------------

Iterative solvers are needed to solve large problems with many degrees
of freedom. The 2012 **open source** version of the `AGMG
<http://agmg.eu/>`_ iterative solver is provided as a
`submodule <https://github.com/BattMoTeam/agmg>`_, as well as `AMGCL
<https://github.com/ddemidov/amgcl>`_ are supported.

Tutorials
---------

Tutorials are presented in `documentation <https://BattMoTeam.github.io/BattMo/>`_.
