Control models
==============

The battery :battmo:`model <Battery#19>` contains a *Control* sub-model, see the overall model structure
:ref:`description<architecture:BattMo Model Architecture>`. The Control model determine the control *values* and *type*.


At a **given time**, there are in general two control types:

* Total current
* Voltage  

Given a control type, the control *value* can change in time.


Json input interface
====================


The most standard controls can be called from BattMo using the json interface:

* Constant Current Discharge (CCDischarge)
* Constant Current Charge (CCCharge)
* Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV)

The parameters for each of the model are described in the json schema :battmofile:`ControlModel.schema.json
<Utilities/JsonSchemas/ControlModel.schema.json>`. Let us review them by looking at examples. For all controls, we have
a given :code:`CRate`. The property :code:`controlPolicy` is used to set the control model.

**Constant Current Discharge**

Before the simulation starts, the capacity of the battery is computed. The battery capacity value is used to compute the
given input current from the CRate value. For a constant current discharge, we have a lower cutoff voltage where the
simulation stops.  The parameter :code:`useCVswitch` can be used if we want to continue the simulation until a given
fixed time, by switching to voltage control. At the start of the simulation, strong non-linearities in the equations may
create difficulties to reach the activation potential. For this reason, there is the possibility to use a *rampup time*
where the current is gradually increased from zero to the targeted given input current. 

.. code:: json

   "Control": {
    "controlPolicy": "CCDischarge",
    "rampupTime": 0.1,
    "CRate": 1,
    "lowerCutoffVoltage": 2.4
  }

For the dataset given :battmofile:`here
<ParameterData/BatteryCellParameters/LithiumIonBatteryCell/lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json>`, we obtain the
following result.

**Constant Current Charge**

In the same way as the discharge case, the capacity of the battery is computed first to set the given input current from
the CRate. When the upper cuttoff voltage limit is reached, the control type is switched to voltage control. Also in
this case, we can include a rampup time. As an example,


.. code:: json

   "Control": {
    "controlPolicy": "CCCharge",
    "rampupTime": 0.1,
    "CRate": 1,
    "upperCutoffVoltage": 4.1,
  }

For the dataset given :battmofile:`here
<ParameterData/BatteryCellParameters/LithiumIonBatteryCell/lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json>`, we obtain the
following result.

   Constant Current Charge control

**Constant Current Constant Charge**

An example of input is

.. code:: json

   "Control": {
    "controlPolicy": "CCCV",
    "CRate": 1,
    "initialControl": "discharging",
    "numberOfCycles": 2,
    "lowerCutoffVoltage": 2.4,
    "upperCutoffVoltage": 4.1,
    "dIdtLimit": 1e-5,
    "dEdtLimit": 1e-5
  },

The control type and value are set following the following procedure. In the case above, we start by discharging

1. We use a constant discharge current computed from the capacity and the given CRate. We keep this value until the
   lower cutoff voltage value is reached. Then, we switch to step 2.
2. The control is set to zero. At each time step we compute the time derivative of the voltage
   :math:`\frac{dE}{dt}`. When this value reach the limit given by :code:`dEdtLimit`. We start the charge step 3.
3. We use a constant charge current. The value is the same as in step 1, with opposite sign. We keep this current until
   the lower cutoff voltage limit is reached. Then we switch to constant voltage control step 4.
4. We use a constant voltage given by the cutoff value and monitor the current derivative :math:`\frac{dI}{dt}`. When
   this value is lower than :code:`dIdtLimit`, we start again the discharge by going to step 1.

We iterate this process for the given number of cycles. For the dataset given :battmofile:`here
<ParameterData/BatteryCellParameters/LithiumIonBatteryCell/lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json>`, we obtain the
following result.
