Introduction
=================================
The Battery Modelling Toolbox (**BatMo**) is a resource for continuum modelling of electrochemical devices in MATLAB. The initial development features a pseudo X-dimensional (PXD) framework for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model of lithium-ion battery cells. However, the development plan for BatMo includes extensions to other battery chemistries (e.g. metal-air) and eventually hydrogen systems (i.e. electrolyzers and fuel cells).

**BatMo** offers users a flexible framework for building fully coupled electrochemical-thermal simulations of electrochemical devices using 1D, 2D, or 3D geometries. **BatMo** is implemented in MATLAB and builds on the open-source MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) developed at SINTEF. MRST provides a solid basis for finite volume mesh generation of complex geometries and advanced numerical solvers that enable fast simulations for large systems.
