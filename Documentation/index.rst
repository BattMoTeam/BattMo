Welcome
=======

Welcome to the Battery Modelling Toolbox (**BattMo**), a comprehensive solution for continuum modelling of electrochemical devices in `MATLAB <https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`_ and `Julia <https://julialang.org/>`_!

**BattMo** facilitates a deep understanding of these devices by simulating cell-level performance in a virtual space. It allows you to calculate dynamic spatial profiles for essential quantities like concentration, electric potential, and temperature. Initially, **BattMo** focuses on the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model for lithium-ion battery cells but has a broader development plan that includes extensions to other battery chemistries such as Na-ion, solid-state, metal-air, and zinc-based systems, along with hydrogen systems like electrolyzers and fuel cells.

Our toolbox offers a flexible framework for building fully coupled electrochemical-thermal simulations with 1D, 2D, or 3D geometries. Powered by the open-source MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST), **BattMo** provides efficient finite volume grid generation and advanced numerical solvers, ensuring swift simulations even for complex systems. Whether you're a researcher or developer, **BattMo** is your gateway to unlocking the potential of continuum modelling for electrochemical devices. Dive into our documentation and explore the possibilities!
