BattMoApp is a user-friendly web application that leverages the powerful BattMo.jl simulation software to model battery cells with precision and speed. It offers a suite 
of features designed to make battery simulations easy, intuitive, and accessible. For now it only utilizes BattMo's P2D model, but
as BattMo.jl expands its models, BattMoApp will follow along with that development.

Accessing BattMoApp is as simple as navigating to `app.batterymodel.com <app.batterymodel.com>`_. Once there, you'll find an intuitive interface guiding you through the simulation setup process.

It is also possible to install BattMoApp locally with Docker. On the `github <https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMoApp>`_ page you can find detailed instructions on how to install the app using Docker.
