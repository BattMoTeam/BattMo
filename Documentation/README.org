* Configuratiom file
  - ~conf.py~ see https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html
* Examples
** Compilation
   - run ~publishExamplesXML~ in ~utils~ directory (see documentation there) : It creates XML outputs
   - run python script ~buildPublishedExamples.py~ : converts XML to rST output
** rST description file
   - Matlab uses own markup language which complicates transformation to rST file and therefore it *should not* be used
   - We offer possibility to include extra rST description file automatically. If the example is named ~myexample.m~,
     then the extra rST file should be named ~myexample_.rst~ (note the underscore sign)
** Guidelines
   - To make sure that a comment you include in matlab example file appears as a comment in rST output (and not at a
     comment in the matlab code formatting), start a cell with eventually no title. In Matlab cells start with ~%%~ and
     a title
   - The directive ~.. automodule::~ makes sure a directory is parsed.
