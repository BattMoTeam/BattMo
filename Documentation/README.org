#+TITLE: Documentation generation for BattMo
* Requirements
** sphinx
   installation instruction described [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html][here]]
   #+begin_src
     pip install sphinx
   #+end_src
** install sphinx rtd theme
   https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-theme/
   #+begin_src
     pip install sphinx-rtd-theme
   #+end_src
** bibtex extension
   https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installation
   #+begin_src
     pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex
   #+end_src
** globabsubs extension
   #+begin_src
     pip install sphinxcontrib-globalsubs
   #+end_src
** youtube
   #+begin_src shell
     pip install sphinxcontrib-youtube
   #+end_src
** collapse
   #+begin_src shell
     python -m pip install sphinx_collapse
   #+end_src   
** autosectionlabel
   - part of default distribution
   - We use ~autosectionlabel_prefix_document = True~ which means that the internal link must be prefixed by the file
     name and a semi-column, see [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autosectionlabel.html][here]].
   
* Workflow for editing

  In the ~Documentation~ directory, run from terminal
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make html
  #+END_SRC

  The command generates all the files for a static website and writes them in ~Documentation/_build/html~

  When the changes are pushed, the documentation is also automatically compiled on github using github actions


  The deployment of the webpage can be followed from the [[https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo/actions][github page section]]

  The result can be view at

  https://battmoteam.github.io/BattMo/

* Special workflow for example scripts
** Compilation
   - run ~publishExamplesXML~ in ~utils~ directory (see documentation there) : It creates XML outputs
   - run python script ~buildPublishedExamples.py~ : converts XML to rST output
** rST description file
   - Matlab uses own markup language which complicates transformation to rST file and therefore it *should not* be used
   - We offer possibility to include extra rST description file automatically. If the example is named ~myexample.m~,
     then the extra rST file should be named ~myexamplePreamble.rst~
** Guidelines
   - To make sure that a comment you include in matlab example file appears as a comment in rST output (and not at a
     comment in the matlab code formatting), start a cell with eventually no title. In Matlab cells start with ~%%~ and
     a title
   - The directive ~.. automodule::~ makes sure a directory is parsed.
