Unsuccessful simulation
####################################
Did your parameter values result in an unsuccessful simulation? See if one of the described cases below is similar to your case.
It might help solving your problem.

Using LiFePO4 datasets
------------------------
Do you obtain an unsuccessful simulation when using one of the default LiFePO4 datasets? 
Make sure that you set the upper cutoff voltage (under Protocol) to a value that is realistic for a battery cell containing an LFP cathode. Try setting it 
to 3.6 and see if it results in a successful simulation this time.
