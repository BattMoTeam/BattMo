    "In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple P4D simulation in BattMo. First, we explored how to combine parameter sets coming from a handful of different files into a single coherent BattMo model description. Then we had a closer look into the Geometry description to see how BattMo knows how to setup a P4D or P2D type model. After running the P4D simulation, we learned how to visualize simulation results on a 3D grid. For comparison, we ran the same model in a P2D configuration and plotted the discharge curves together. This showed that the results can diverge somewhat due to the effects of the tabs and non\\-ideal transport in the electrode plane. These results show that P4D models can yield important insight that may be lost in the averaged approach of P2D models.\n",
