* How to initialise the model

Initial concentration and potential in the model can be calculated based on equilibrium values for the given input paramaters. This can be done by calling initialiseState on a BatteryModel object:

#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
  model.initialiseState()
#+END_SRC

Alternatively a state structure contatining concentration and potential for all the relevant submodels can be given.


* Calculating intial concentration

Concentration is calculated using the intial SOC of the battery.


* Calculating initial potential
