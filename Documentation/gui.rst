==========
BattMo App
==========

A web-based graphical user-interface of BattMo is under development. At the moment, this application 
utilizes the Julia version of BattMo and has the possibility to do simulations using the P2D model.
The application is very easy to use, intuitive and can be easily accessed at `http://app.batterymodel.com/ <http://app.batterymodel.com/>`_.

.. note::
  This section is still under development.

This section provides a description on some of its features.
It gives details on some of the calculation that are done within the application, like for example the calculation of the cell mass and specific capacities.
Furthermore, it provides some troubleshooting for when simulations aren't successful or when the results contain unexpected artifacts.
