  %% BattMo Tutorial
  % This tutorial explains how to setup and run a simulation in BattMo
  
  % First clear variables stored in memory and close all figures
  clear;
  close all;
  
  % Set thicker line widths and larger font sizes
  set(0, 'defaultLineLineWidth', 3);
  set(0, 'defaultAxesFontSize', 16);
  set(0, 'defaultTextFontSize', 18);
  
  %% Setting up the environment
  % BattMo uses functionality from :mod:`MRST <MRSTBattMo>`. This functionality
  % is collected into modules where each module contains code for doing
  % specific things. To use this functionality we must add these modules to
  % the matlab path by running:
  
  mrstModule add ad-core mrst-gui mpfa agmg linearsolvers
  
  %% Specifying the physical model
  % In this tutorial we will simulate a lithium-ion battery consisting of a
  % negative electrode, a positive electrode and an electrolyte. *BattMo*
  % comes with some pre-defined models which can be loaded from JSON files.
  % Here we will load the basic lithium-ion model JSON file which comes with
  % Battmo. We use :battmo:`parseBattmoJson` to parse the file.
  
  fname = fullfile('ParameterData','BatteryCellParameters',...
                   'LithiumIonBatteryCell','lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json');
  jsonstruct = parseBattmoJson(fname);
  
  %%
  % The parseBattmoJson function parses the JSON input and creates a matlab
  % structure containing the same fields as the JSON input. This structure
  % can be changed to setup the model in the way that we want.
  %
  % In this instance we will exclude temperature effects by setting
  % use_thermal to false.
  
  jsonstruct.use_thermal = false;
  
  %%
  % We will also not use current collectors in this example:
  
  jsonstruct.include_current_collectors = false;
  
  %%
  % The structure created in the jsonstruct follows the same hierarchy as the
  % fields in the JSON input file. These can be referenced by name in the
  % jsonstruct. To make life easier for ourselves we define some shorthand
  % names for various parts of the structure.
  
  ne      = 'NegativeElectrode';
  pe      = 'PositiveElectrode';
  elyte   = 'Electrolyte';
  thermal = 'ThermalModel';
  co      = 'Coating';
  am      = 'ActiveMaterial';
  itf     = 'Interface';
  sd      = 'SolidDiffusion';
  ctrl    = 'Control';
  cc      = 'CurrentCollector';
  
  %%
  % Now we can set the diffusion model type for the active material (am) in the
  % positive (pe) and negative (ne) electrodes to 'full'.
  
  jsonstruct.(pe).(am).diffusionModelType = 'full';
  jsonstruct.(ne).(am).diffusionModelType = 'full';
  
  %%
  % To see which other types of diffusion model are available one can view
  % :battmo:`ActiveMaterialInputParams`.  When running a simulation, *BattMo* requires that all model parameters
  % are stored in an instance of :battmo:`BatteryInputParams`.
  % This class is used to initialize the simulation and is accessed by
  % various parts of the simulator during the simulation. This class is
  % instantiated using the jsonstruct we just created:
  
  inputparams = BatteryInputParams(jsonstruct);
  
  %%
  % It is also possible to update the properties of this inputparams in a
  % similar way to updating the jsonstruct. Here we set the discretisation
  % level for the diffusion model. Other input parameters for the full diffusion
  % model can be found here:
  % :battmo:`FullSolidDiffusionModelInputParams`.
  
  inputparams.(ne).(co).(am).(sd).N = 5;
  inputparams.(pe).(co).(am).(sd).N = 5;
  
  % We can also change how the battery is operated, for example setting
  % the cut off voltage.
  inputparams.(ctrl).lowerCutoffVoltage = 2.5;
  
  %% Setting up the geometry
  % Here, we setup the 1D computational grid that will be used for the
  % simulation. The required discretization parameters are already included
  % in the class :battmo:`BatteryGeneratorP2D`. Classes for generating other geometries can
  % be found in the BattMo/Battery/BatteryGeometry folder.
  
  gen = BatteryGeneratorP2D();
  
  %%
  % Now, we update the inputparams with the properties of the grid. This function
  % will update relevent parameters in the inputparams object and make sure we have
  % all the required parameters for the model geometry chosen.
  
  inputparams = gen.updateBatteryInputParams(inputparams);
  
  %% Initialising the battery model object
  % The battery model is initialized by sending inputparams to the Battery class
  % constructor. see :battmo:`Battery`.
  %
  % In BattMo a battery model is actually a collection of submodels:
  % Electrolyte, Negative Electrode, Positive Electrode, Thermal Model and Control
  % Model. The battery class contains all of these submodels and various other
  % parameters necessary to run the simulation.
  
  model = Battery(inputparams);
  
  %% Plotting the OCP curves against state of charge
  % We can inspect the model object to find out which parameters are being
  % used. For instance the information we need to plot the OCP curves for the
  % positive and negative electrodes can be found in the interface structure
  % of each electrode.

  %% Controlling the simulation
  % The control model specifies how the battery is operated, i.e., how the simulation is controlled.
  %
  % The input parameters for the control have been given as part of the json structure
  % :battmofile:`ParameterData/BatteryCellParameters/LithiumIonBatteryCell/lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json`. The
  % total simulation time is setup for us, computed from the CRate value. We use the method :code:`setupScheduleStep` in
  % :battmo:`ControlModel` to setup the :code:`step` structure.
  
  step = model.Control.setupScheduleStep();
  
  %%
  % We create a control structure containing the source function and
  % and a stopping criteria. The control parameters have been given in the json file
  % :battmofile:`ParameterData/BatteryCellParameters/LithiumIonBatteryCell/lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json`
  %
  % The :code:`setupScheduleControl` method contains the code to setup the control structure that is used in the schedule
  % structure setup below.
  
  control = model.Control.setupScheduleControl();
  
  %%
  % Finally we collect the control and step structures together in a schedule
  % struct which is the schedule which the simulation will follow:
  
  schedule = struct('control', control, 'step', step);
  
  
  %% Setting the initial state of the battery
  % To run simulation we need to know the starting point which we will run it
  % from, in terms of the value of the primary variables being modelled at
  % the start of the simulation.
  % The initial state of the model is setup using model.setupInitialState()
  % Here we take the state of charge (SOC) given in the input and calculate
  % equilibrium concentration based on theta0, theta100 and cmax.
  
  initstate = model.setupInitialState();
  
  %% Running the simulation
  % Once we have the initial state, the model and the schedule, we can call
  % the simulateScheduleAD function which will actually run the simulation.
  %
  % The outputs from the simulation are:
  % - sols: which provides the current and voltage of the battery at each
  %   timestep.
  % - states: which contains the values of the primary variables in the model
  %   at each timestep.
  % - reports: which contains technical information about the steps used in
  %   the numerical solvers.
  
  [sols, states, report] = simulateScheduleAD(initstate, model, schedule);
  
  
  %% Plotting the results
  % To get the results we use the matlab cellfun function to extract the
  % values Control.E, Control.I and time from each timestep (cell in the cell
  % array) in states. We can then plot the vectors.
  
  E = cellfun(@(x) x.Control.E, states);
  I = cellfun(@(x) x.Control.I, states);
  time = cellfun(@(x) x.time, states);
