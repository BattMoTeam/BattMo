Features
#########

BattMoApp offers a multiple features designed to streamline and enhance the process of battery cell simulation. 
Below is a detailed overview of the core features provided by BattMoApp.


Utilize Default Materials
--------------------------
Kickstart your simulations using our curated library of default materials, 
compiled from literature sources. 
Explore the available materials on the `Materials and models <http://app.batterymodel.com/Materials_and_models>`_  page, 
complete with references and dataset details.

Customize with Your Own Materials
----------------------------------
Do you have specific material data from your research or literature? 
BattMoApp allows you to input custom material parameters. 
On the `Simulation <http://app.batterymodel.com/Simulation>`_ page, select 'User defined' from the material dropdown, 
and input your parameters in the expanded section. 
You can also reference default material values from the `Materials and models <http://app.batterymodel.com/Materials_and_models>`_ page.


Visualize Your Battery Geometry
-----------------------------------
Curious about how your battery cell looks based on your input parameters? 
Our geometry visualization tool on the `Simulation <http://app.batterymodel.com/Simulation>`_ page graphically represents your battery cell, 
reflecting component thicknesses, porosities, length, and width.


Download Input Data
--------------------------
After configuring your simulation parameters, download them in two formats:

- JSON Linked Data Format: Structured data with metadata, adhering to `FAIR data principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_ and the `5 star open data guidelines <https://5stardata.info/en/>`_ .

- BattMo JSON Input Format: Compatible with BattMo's input requirements.

This feature ensures better data management and reproducibility.


Upload Input Data
--------------------------
You can upload you previously downloaded input data on the `Simulation <http://app.batterymodel.com/Simulation>`_ page.
When you do this, the parameter values on the page will automatically be adapted to your input file.
This make it very easy to review and alter previous simulations.

Visualize and Download Results
------------------------------------
Once your simulation is complete, delve into the results with our visualization tools. 
Analyze performance metrics, observe trends, and download the data for further examination or reporting.

Upload your previous results
------------------------------------
You can upload previously downloaded results and visualize them on the `Results <http://app.batterymodel.com/Results>`_ page.
This makes it very easy to review previous results and compare them with new results.
