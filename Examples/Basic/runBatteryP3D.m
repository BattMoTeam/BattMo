%% Pseudo-Three-Dimensional (P3D) Lithium-Ion Battery Model
% This example demonstrates how to setup a P3D model of a Li-ion battery
% and run a simple simulation.

% Clear the workspace and close open figures

close all

%% Import the required modules from MRST
% load MRST modules
mrstModule add ad-core mrst-gui mpfa

%% Setup the properties of Li-ion battery materials and cell design
% The properties and parameters of the battery cell, including the
% architecture and materials, are set using an instance of
% :class:`BatteryInputParams <Battery.BatteryInputParams>`. This class is
% used to initialize the simulation and it propagates all the parameters
% throughout the submodels. The input parameters can be set manually or
% provided in json format. All the parameters for the model are stored in
% the inputparams object.
jsonstruct = parseBattmoJson(fullfile('ParameterData', 'BatteryCellParameters', 'LithiumIonBatteryCell', 'lithium_ion_battery_nmc_graphite.json'));
jsonstruct.include_current_collectors = false;
inputparams = BatteryInputParams(jsonstruct);

% We define some shorthand names for simplicity.
ne      = 'NegativeElectrode';
pe      = 'PositiveElectrode';
co      = 'Coating';
am      = 'ActiveMaterial';
cc      = 'CurrentCollector';
elyte   = 'Electrolyte';
sep     = 'Separator';
thermal = 'ThermalModel';
ctrl    = 'Control';

%% Setup the geometry and computational grid
% Here, we setup the 2D computational grid that will be used for the
% simulation. The required discretization parameters are already included
% in the class BatteryGeneratorP3D.
gen = BatteryGeneratorP3D();

% Now, we update the inputparams with the properties of the grid.
inputparams = gen.updateBatteryInputParams(inputparams);

% change some of the values of the paramaters that were given in the json
% file to other values. This is done directly on the object inputparams.
inputparams.(ne).(cc).effectiveElectronicConductivity = 1e5;
inputparams.(pe).(cc).effectiveElectronicConductivity = 1e5;

%%  Initialize the battery model.
% The battery model is initialized by sending inputparams to the Battery class
% constructor. see :class:`Battery <Battery.Battery>`.
model = Battery(inputparams);

%% Plot the grid
plotBatteryGrid(model, 'setstyle', false);

%% Compute the nominal cell capacity and choose a C-Rate
% The nominal capacity of the cell is calculated from the active materials.
% This value is then combined with the user-defined C-Rate to set the cell
% operational current.
C      = computeCellCapacity(model);
DRate  = 1;
inputI = (C/hour)*DRate; % current

%% Setup the time step schedule
% Smaller time steps are used to ramp up the current from zero to its
% operational value. Larger time steps are then used for the normal
% operation.

timestep.numberOfTimeSteps = 50;
timestep.useRampup = true;

step = model.(ctrl).setupScheduleStep(timestep);

%% Setup the operating limits for the cell
% The maximum and minimum voltage limits for the cell are defined using stopping and source functions.
control = model.(ctrl).setupScheduleControl();

% This control is used to set up the schedule
schedule = struct('control', control, 'step', step);

%% Setup the initial state of the model
% The initial state of the model is dispatched using the
% model.setupInitialState()method.
initstate = model.setupInitialState();

%% Setup the properties of the nonlinear solver
nls = NonLinearSolver();
% Change default maximum iteration number in nonlinear solver
nls.maxIterations = 10;
% Change default behavior of nonlinear solver, in case of error
nls.errorOnFailure = false;
% Timestep selector
nls.timeStepSelector = StateChangeTimeStepSelector('TargetProps', {{ctrl, 'E'}}, ...
                                                  'targetChangeAbs', 0.03);

% Change default tolerance for nonlinear solver
model.nonlinearTolerance = 1e-5;
% Set verbosity of the solver (if true, value of the residuals for every equation is given)
model.verbose = true;

%% Run simulation
[~, states, report] = simulateScheduleAD(initstate, model, schedule, ...
                                                'OutputMinisteps', true, ...
                                                'NonLinearSolver', nls);

%%  Process output and recover the output voltage and current from the output states.
ind = cellfun(@(x) not(isempty(x)), states);
states = states(ind);
E = cellfun(@(x) x.(ctrl).E, states);
I = cellfun(@(x) x.(ctrl).I, states);
time = cellfun(@(x) x.time, states);

figure
plot(time/hour, E);
grid on
xlabel 'time  / h';
ylabel 'potential  / V';

%% Plot an animated summary of the results
doplot = false;
if doplot
    plotDashboard(model, states, 'step', 0);
end
